        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No bacon, no fruit, no seeds: this broccoli salad, adapted from a recipe in a newspaper clipping from 1980,
            combines potato salad flavors--hard-cooked eggs, dill, celery seed, mayo--with crisp fresh broccoli.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 pound broccoli, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped red onion</li>
            <li>1 cup green olives, sliced</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) jar diced pimentos, drained</li>
            <li>¾ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>½ pinch salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon celery seed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover
                the saucepan and
                bring the water to a boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, remove from the heat and let the
                eggs stand in the
                hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water, then cool the eggs under cold running water in the
                sink. Peel and chop
                once cold.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and cook uncovered
                until bright green
                and just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several
                minutes until
                cold to stop the cooking process. Once the broccoli is cold, drain well and set aside.</li>
            <li> Combine the red onion, hard-cooked eggs, green olives, pimentos, mayonnaise, mustard powder, salt,
                celery seed, and dill
                in a mixing bowl. Stir in the drained cooked broccoli. Refrigerate overnight for best flavor.</li>
