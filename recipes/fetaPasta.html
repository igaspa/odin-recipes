        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I've given the baked feta trend a spring/summer twist. Full of veggies like asparagus, zucchini, corn, and
            peppers, and
            baked until golden brown and delicious.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pint grape tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 bunch asparagus, trimmed and chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and cut in 1/4 inch slices</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 ear fresh sweet corn, kernels cut from the cob</li>
            <li>1 medium red bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package block feta cheese</li>
            <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>½ medium lemon</li>
            <li>¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Pecorino Romano cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package rigatoni pasta</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) </li>
            <li>Combine grape tomatoes, asparagus, zucchini, onion, bell pepper, and corn kernels in a baking dish large
                enough to
                accommodate all vegetables. Drizzle generously with olive oil and sprinkle with pepper flakes as well as
                a hit of salt
                and pepper. Toss to coat and make a well in the center of the dish. Place feta blocks in the well and
                drizzle with more
                olive oil. Season feta with salt, pepper, and a pinch of pepper flakes. Nestle thyme sprigs into the
                veggies around the
                dish.</li>
            <li> Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until vegetables are soft and feta is lightly browned, about 40
                minutes.</li>
            <li>When the vegetables and feta have cooked for 25 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a
                boil. Cook
                rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12
                minutes. Drain,
                reserving 1 cup of pasta water. Set aside.</li>
            <li>When the vegetables and feta are finished cooking, turn the broiler to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) and
                broil
                vegetables for 1 minute for some final browning.</li>
            <li>Squeeze lemon over vegetables and feta and stir in fresh parsley. Stir in rigatoni and reserved pasta
                water to help feta
                coat pasta evenly. Season with salt and pepper as needed and sprinkle with Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
        </ol>
